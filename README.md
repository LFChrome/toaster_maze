### Your Project Members
Alizah, Jordan, and Wei
### What is the name of your project?    
The Toaster Maze
### What does this project do?
Explore the challenges of the The Toaster Maze to see different rooms of the maze and complete it without losing toasts
### Who did you design this project for?
To the slice of bread that dares to be toasted one day to become a toast...
### What was your inspiration for this project?
A common thing we came out with during brainstorming was "the toast." We found it very funny so we decided to create a maze around toasts
### What challenges did you run into?
The page auto-refreshes everytime a change is made, which made it very complicated to test the code.
Also, the room system is complicated to keep track of.
### What accomplishments are you most proud of?
- We successfully created 14 rooms with some with unique interactivity and loot.
- We created a rock, paper, scissors game in one of the rooms.
Which ones? Dare, disrupt and explore The Toaster Maze to find out!
### What did your team learn?
- We learned that arrays can store functions, which simplified the code significantly.
- We also learned linear gradient, which made buttons exquisite buttons.
